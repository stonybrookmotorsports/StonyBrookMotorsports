Stony Brook Motorsports is comprised of students from a variety of academic backgrounds and standings.  Since 1987, this organization has demonstrated the competitive spirit and dedication to academic excellence of Stony Brook University.  Members of Stony Brook Motorsports take part in a real-world engineering design project sanctioned by SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers).  These students have the opportunity to use the skills they learn in the classroom to design, build, and test a unique off-road vehicle which goes on to compete at an international level.  Team members must also manage the administrative and financial aspects of a project of this scale, all while balancing their academic responsibilities.
