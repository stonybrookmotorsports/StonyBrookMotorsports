Stony Brook Motorsports is an undergraduate student organization at Stony Brook University.  Since 1987, the team has competed in Baja SAE, a real-world engineering design project sanctioned by SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers).  Students use the skills they learn in the classroom to design, build, test, and race an off-road vehicle.

#### Mechanical Design and Fabrication
Students design the car based on new rules each year, using numerical analysis, 3D modeling software, and computer simulation software.  Students fabricate most of the car from scratch, including our custom gearbox and suspension, using equipment including hand tools, manual mill and lathe, and CNC mill.

#### Electronics
Students use an assortment of sensors during testing to acquire information such as acceleration, suspension travel, and component temperatures, to verify computer simulations.

#### Business
Students give a sales presentation at competition,  where they propose a business model to take our car into mass production.  Students also manage  all the administrative and financial aspects of the project.



Stony Brook Motorsports is comprised of students from a variety of academic backgrounds and standings.  Since 1987, this organization has demonstrated the competitive spirit and dedication to academic excellence of Stony Brook University.  Members of Stony Brook Motorsports take part in a real-world engineering design project sanctioned by SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers).  These students have the opportunity to use the skills they learn in the classroom to design, build, and test a unique off-road vehicle which goes on to compete at an international level.  Team members must also manage the administrative and financial aspects of a project of this scale, all while balancing their academic responsibilities.
