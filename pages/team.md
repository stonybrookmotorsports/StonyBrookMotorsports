All Stony Brook students, regardless of year, major, or experience, are welcome to join the team.  Just come to our meetings!  General Body Meetings are held Wednesdays during campus lifetime, and Fabrication Meetings are held Saturday mornings in our shop in the basement of Heavy Engineering (HE 014).  Check our [calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/) for up-to-date meeting times and locations.  Feel free to [contact]({{site.baseurl}}/contact) us if you have any questions.
