All Stony Brook students are welcome to join the team.  No experience is required, and all majors and years are welcome.  Just come to our meetings: General Body Meetings are held Wednesdays during campus lifetime, and Fabrication Meetings are held Saturday mornings in our shop in the basement of Heavy Engineering (HE 014).  Check our [calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/#meetings) for up-to-date meeting times and locations.

See the [forms]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/forms) page to join our email and Slack groups, and instructions for safety training.
Feel free to [contact]({{site.baseurl}}/contact) us if you have any questions.
